<h2>
This is a set of Japanease RoadSigns.
</h2>
<br>

We have used RoadSigns on the web-sites to create a samll dataset<br>
<li><a href="http://www.jaf.or.jp/e/for-overseas-drivers/driving-in-japan.htm">JAF</a></li><br>
<li><a href="https://japandriverslicense.com/japanese-road-signs/">JAPAN DRIVER'S LICENCE </a></li><br>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Japan">Road signs in Japan</a></li><br>

<br>
The images in each roadsign category are generated by using Keras ImaeDataGenerator from the base images on the web-sites above.
The size of each image in the small dataset is (120, 120, 3), which implys 120 pixels x 120 pixels x 3 channels. <br>
This may be a better recognizable size than (32, 32, 3) to humans and CNN model.
